# Project_Wordle

## Description

-   A simplistic wordle application using Java, will provide you with a 5 letter word which will need to be guessed, for each letter in the guessed word will either say its in the correct spot and correct letter, incorrect spot but correct letter, or not in word at all

## How to run

-   Simply run the main file using whatever preferred code editor you wish

## Developer thoughts

-   The job is simple enough, just check through all letters in it and print out the result, although the only issue i had done is accidentally made hangman instead since i didnt actually know what wordle was until i googled it up
