# Project_Wordle

## Description

-   A simplistic wordle application using Java, will provide you with a 5 letter word which will need to be guessed, for each letter in the guessed word will either say its in the correct spot and correct letter, incorrect spot but correct letter, or not in word at all, will also do a API call inside of JAVA (Not JavaScript) and will show the definition of the word

## How to run

-   Simply run go inside the src/main/Main and run with preferably eclipse, as the project uses maven

## Developer thoughts

-   The job is simple enough, just check through all letters in it and print out the result, although the only issue i had done is accidentally made hangman instead since i didnt actually know what wordle was until i googled it up
- although it was easy enough as it was, it was kinda boring, so i decided to do an api call for the word found when you discover it which will get the definition for it
which was a new experience for me since i havent called API's in JAVA yet which is neat, was a pain in the butt but it works :)
